    "This script automates the extraction of new product information from SEC 10-K filings for a set of S&P 500 companies. It performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Data:**  \n",
    "   Reads a CSV file containing company data (including CIK, ticker, and market cap) from the WIKI_COMPANY_SCRAPE_CSV.py script.\n",
    "   **Note:**\n",
    "   This was done to save time during testing. The CSV is provided but you could pull some different subsets of companys using the provided WIKI_COMPANY_SCRAPE_CSV.py script. \n",
    "2. **Fetch Filings:**  \n",
    "   Retrieves the latest 10-K filing for each company from the SEC EDGAR database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clean Text:**  \n",
    "   Cleans the raw filing text by removing HTML, URLs, extraneous numbers, and boilerplate language to prepare it for LLM analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extract Products:**  \n",
    "   Sends the cleaned text to the GPT-4O-MINI model via the OpenAI client to extract new product names and descriptions in JSON format. The script then parses the JSON output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save Output:**  \n",
    "   Writes the extracted product information along with company details to an output CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "This script features robust error handling throughout, ensuring that network issues, parsing errors, and API errors are properly managed and logged.\n"
